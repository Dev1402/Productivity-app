Here's a **high-level System Design** for the VibeMatch app, designed with scalability, modularity, and fun gameplay + AI integration in mind — while respecting your constraints (teen-focused, no chat system initially, AI persona engine, mini-games, etc.).

### 🔹 2. **Modules and Components**

#### 🧑‍💼 **Frontend (Flutter App)**

- Onboarding UI
- Quiz UI with progress bar
- Persona display screen (Vibe meter, tags)
- Daily match cards
- Game 1 and Game 2 UI
- Compatibility score + feedback view
- No chat UI (structured CTA cards instead)

#### ⚙️ **Backend (FastAPI)**

1. **Auth Service**
   - OTP login/signup
   - Age verification
   - (Optional) Parental consent flow

2. **User Service**
   - Create/update user profile
   - Store persona archetype
   - Store user settings and preferences

3. **Quiz Service**
   - Serve questions
   - Store responses
   - Submit and vectorize data

4. **Persona Engine**
   - Proxy call to OpenAI with prompt template
   - Receive and store persona object (title, description, vector)

5. **Matching Engine**
   - Daily 3-match suggestion based on cosine similarity
   - Update match status
   - Include past game history into scoring weight

6. **Game Engine**
   - Game session creation & validation
   - Store player choices
   - Run scoring logic (custom or AI-assisted)
   - Trigger feedback & compatibility scoring

7. **Compatibility Engine**
   - Score alignment across VVV (values, vibes, vision)
   - AI-generated textual feedback using OpenAI
   - Radar chart data generator

8. **Next-Step Recommender**
   - Based on match score thresholds
   - Suggest new game, shared activity, or interaction path

### 🔹 3. **Data Model Highlights (PostgreSQL)**

#### 📌 Core Tables

- `users`: ID, age, gender, location, persona_id
- `personas`: ID, title, description, vibe_score, value_score, vision_score
- `quiz_responses`: user_id, question_id, answer
- `matches`: user_1_id, user_2_id, match_score, status
- `game_sessions`: session_id, match_id, game_type, scores
- `compatibility_scores`: game_id, score_vector, insights_text

---

### 🔹 4. **AI Usage**

| Component | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| OpenAI GPT | Generate persona archetype from quiz answers |
| OpenAI Embedding | Vectorize personality profile for matching |
| GPT Text Gen | Generate feedback after each game (e.g., \"You value creativity and humor\") |

---

### 🔹 5. **Security & Moderation**

- Age gating + parental consent flow
- Basic report/block system (flag inappropriate behavior)
- No real-time chat (structured interactions only)
- Rate limiting + API security via API keys or OAuth2

---

### 🔹 6. **Scalability Plan (Post-MVP)**

- Move to microservices if traffic grows
- Add Redis for matchmaking queue or real-time game coordination
- Switch to Firebase Auth if scaling OTP auth
- Use a vector database (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate) if embedding scale increases
