# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## **Product Name:** VibeMatch (Placeholder)
**Owner:** Devansh Chawla  
**Date:** March 21, 2025  
**Version:** v0.1 (MVP)

---

## **1. Problem Statement**

Current matchmaking and friendship apps rely on superficial indicators (photos, bios, swipes), leading to low-quality connections and ghosting. There is no engaging way to assess **deep compatibility** based on **Vibes, Vision, and Values** before committing time and energy.

### **Key Issues with Existing Apps:**
- Overemphasis on looks and short bios
- Shallow interactions leading to poor engagement
- No structured way to assess long-term compatibility
- Users feel drained by endless texting and ghosting

### **Solution:**
VibeMatch is a **fun-first**, structured matchmaking app where users:
1. Take a short onboarding quiz to assess their **Vibes, Vision, and Values**.
2. Get AI-generated personality insights and matched with compatible users.
3. Engage in **mini-games** that reveal their true compatibility.
4. If the interaction score is high, the system recommends structured next steps (e.g., new game, shared activity, or deeper exploration).
5. **No chat system initially**—matches are built on actions, not conversations.

---

## **2. Product Vision**

To build a **fun, emotionally intelligent matchmaking app** that helps users form **genuine, engaging, and deep connections** based on **personality compatibility** rather than superficial traits.

---

## **3. Goals & Success Metrics**

| Goal | Metric |
|------|--------|
| Validate deep-matching interest | 60% of users complete onboarding |
| Engagement via gameplay | 40% of users play at least 2 games in the first week |
| Perceived match quality | 70% of matches rate the experience >7/10 |
| Viral growth | 20% of users invite others within 1 week |

## **4. Target Audience**

## **5. Core Features (MVP Scope)**

### **1. Onboarding & Personality Quiz**
- **Fast-paced, fun questionnaire (10-15 questions)**
- Includes:
  - "Would You Rather" scenarios
  - **Values-based choices** (e.g., teamwork vs. independence)
  - **Emotional responses** (e.g., reaction to group dynamics or peer pressure)
- Generates **Vibe, Vision, and Values Profile**
- AI assigns users an **archetype** (e.g., "Empathic Strategist")

### **2. Profile & Archetype Display**
- AI-generated **persona overview**
- Key attributes displayed:
  - **Top 3 values**
  - **Future vision tags** (e.g., explorer, builder, helper)
  - **Vibe meter** (e.g., solo vs. social energy)
- Users can edit surface-level details (age, gender, location, intent: friendship/discovery)

### **3. Matching Algorithm**
- **Cosine similarity algorithm** for matching based on:
  - Personality vector (generated from quiz + AI analysis)
  - Shared responses in mini-games
  - Engagement behavior
- **Limited daily matches (3 per day)** to create anticipation

### **4. Mini-Games for Compatibility**
- **1-on-1, asynchronous games** (play anytime)
- **Games focus on revealing compatibility through actions**
- Examples:
  1. **Scenario Swipes** – Choose responses to real-life situations
  2. **The Alignment Game** – Pick priorities from conflicting values
  3. **Memory Lane** – Co-create a fictional story and rate each other's imagination

### **5. Compatibility Scoring & Next Steps**
- **Games generate a compatibility score** based on decision overlaps
- AI provides **insights** post-game:
  - "You both enjoy team-based adventures."
  - "You like solving challenges creatively."
- If the score meets a threshold, system suggests structured next steps:
  - **New game** (to explore more depth)
  - **Shared challenge** (puzzle, list-making, drawing prompts)
  - **Future interaction prompts**
- **No chat system initially** (reduces risk, ghosting & pressure)
